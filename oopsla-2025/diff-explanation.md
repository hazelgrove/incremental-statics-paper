## Explanation of Differences

The most substantial difference is the elaborated section 5.5 on the generalized incrementalization approach. More details are included about how to apply this method to general languages, and additional formalism is included to instantiate the theory with System F polymorphism. 

Another substantial change is in the related works section, where we include more citations of incremental static analysis not in the type checking domain. 

All other changes are minor trims, clarifications, or improvements in wording, or the implementation of changes requested by reviewers and discussed in our response.
