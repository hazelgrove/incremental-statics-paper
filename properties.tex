Omni-commutativity. 

% Given a graph and the corresponding marked grove, and given a *set* of actions that come in, the two should be equivalent:

% 1. 1
%     1. Actions are applied commutatively to the graph 
%     2. The graph is decomposed into a grove
%     3. The grove is marked 
% 2. 2
%     1. The actions are translated to grove actions
%     2. The grove actions are applied to the marked grove
%     3. The marked grove steps until it has no todos 

% No matter how b and c are ordered - even interleaved with each other.

% Graph —————(graph actions)—————→ Graph’

% Grove ——————(grove actions)—————→ Grove’

% |                 =                 |

% Marked ——(mark actions \& steps, mixed)—>* Marked’
