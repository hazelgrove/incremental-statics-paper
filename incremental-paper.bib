abstract = {Self-adjusting computation provides an evaluation model where computations can respond automatically to modifications to their data by using a mechanism for propagating modifications through the computation. Current approaches to self-adjusting computation guarantee correctness by recording dependencies in a trace at the granularity of individual memory operations. Tracing at the granularity of memory operations, however, has some limitations: it can be asymptotically inefficient (eg, compared to optimal solutions) because it cannot take advantage of problem-specific structure, it requires keeping a large computation trace (often proportional to the runtime of the program on the current input), and it introduces moderately large constant factors in practice.In this paper, we extend dependence-tracing to work at the granularity of the query and update operations of arbitrary (abstract) data types, instead of just reads and writes on memory cells. This can significantly reduce the number of dependencies that need to be kept in the trace and followed during an update. We define an interface for supporting a traceable version of a data type, which reports the earliest query that depends on (is changed by) revising operations back in time, and implement several such structures, including priority queues, queues, dictionaries, and counters. We develop a semantics for tracing, extend an existing self-adjusting language, ΔML, and its implementation to support traceable data types, and present an experimental evaluation by considering a number of benchmarks. Our experiments show dramatic improvements on space and time, sometimes by as much as two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Many researchers have proposed programming languages that support incremental computation (IC), which allows programs to be efficiently re-executed after a small change to the input. However, existing implementations of such languages have two important drawbacks. First, recomputation is oblivious to specific demands on the program output; that is, if a program input changes, all dependencies will be recomputed, even if an observer no longer requires certain outputs. Second, programs are made incremental as a unit, with little or no support for reusing results outside of their original context, e.g., when reordered.To address these problems, we present λiccdd, a core calculus that applies a demand-driven semantics to incremental computation, tracking changes in a hierarchical fashion in a novel demanded computation graph. λiccdd also formalizes an explicit separation between inner, incremental computations and outer observers. This combination ensures λiccdd programs only recompute computations as demanded by observers, and allows inner computations to be reused more liberally. We present Adapton, an OCaml library implementing λiccdd. We evaluated Adapton on a range of benchmarks, and found that it provides reliable speedups, and in many cases dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art IC approaches.},

This makes it difficult to perform complex tasks, such as social-graph analysis on changing data at interactive timescales, which would greatly benefit those analyzing the behavior of services like Twitter. In this paper we introduce a new model called differential computation, which extends traditional incremental computation to allow arbitrarily nested iteration, and explain---with reference to a publicly available prototype system called Naiad---how differential computation can be efficiently implemented in the context of a declarative data-parallel dataflow language. The resulting system makes it easy to program previously intractable algorithms such as incrementally updated strongly connected components, and integrate them with data transformation operations to obtain practically relevant insights from real data streams.},

Membership in AFFECTED is not known a priori; this paper presents an algorithm that identifies attributes in AFFECTED and computes their new values.

This paper concerns new attribute-grammar-based methods that, for a suitable class of grammars, overcome this fundamental limitation. The techniques presented allow the updating algorithm to skip over arbitrarily large sections of the tree that more straightforward updating methods visit node by node. These techniques are then extended to deal with aggregate values, so that the attribute updating procedure need only follow dependencies due to a changed component of an aggregate value. Although our methods work only for a restricted class of attribute grammars, satisfying the necessary restrictions should not place an undue burden on the writer of the grammar.},

abstract = {Applications in many domains are based on a series of traversals of tree structures, and fusing these traversals together to reduce the total number of passes over the tree is a common, important optimization technique. In applications such as compilers and render trees, these trees are heterogeneous: different nodes of the tree have different types. Unfortunately, prior work for fusing traversals falls short in different ways: they do not handle heterogeneity; they require using domain-specific languages to express an application; they rely on the programmer to aver that fusing traversals is safe, without any soundness guarantee; or they can only perform coarse-grain fusion, leading to missed fusion opportunities. This paper addresses these shortcomings to build a framework for fusing traversals of heterogeneous trees that is automatic, sound, and fine-grained. We show across several case studies that our approach is able to allow programmers to write simple, intuitive traversals, and then automatically fuse them to substantially improve performance.},

abstract = {Build systems are awesome, terrifying -- and unloved. They are used by every developer around the world, but are rarely the object of study. In this paper we offer a systematic, and executable, framework for developing and comparing build systems, viewing them as related points in landscape rather than as isolated phenomena. By teasing apart existing build systems, we can recombine their components, allowing us to prototype new build systems with desired properties.},

abstract = {Various incremental evaluation strategies for Datalog have been developed that reuse computations for small input changes. These methods assume that incrementalization is always a better strategy than recomputation. However, in real-world applications such as static program analysis, recomputation can be cheaper than incrementalization for large updates. This work introduces an elastic incremental approach with two strategies that can be selected based on the impact of the input change. The first strategy is a Bootstrap strategy that recomputes the entire result for high-impact changes. The second is an Update strategy that performs an incremental update for low-impact changes. Our approach allows for a lightweight Bootstrap strategy suitable for high-impact changes, with the trade-off that Update may require more work for small changes. We demonstrate our approach using real-world applications and compare our elastic incremental approach to existing methods.},
